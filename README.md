# ClueBot
A program I made a while ago to assist you in playing the board game clue.
It has been rotting on my laptop's HDD for 9 months at this point.

There's probably a lot of messy code in it because I really just wanted it to be functional, feel free to make any PRs.

Everything should be sufficiently documented via JavaDocs, if anything is missing feel free to create an issue.
